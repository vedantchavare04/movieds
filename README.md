**🎥 Movie Data Analysis (1915–2020)**

This project focuses on analyzing movie trends from 1915 to 2020, using regression techniques to understand how different movie attributes (such as ratings, revenue, votes, etc.) have evolved over time.
The analysis is performed in Google Colab using popular Python data science libraries.

**🧠 Objective**

To uncover trends and relationships in movie data over more than a century, and visualize these insights using regression plots and other statistical charts.There are few question answered using the data insights.

**🔎 Analysis Overview**

Some highlights of what is included in the notebook:

Movie trends from 1915–2020

Regression plots showing relationships like:

Movie Budget vs Revenue

Interpretation of regression model outputs

**📦 Installation / Requirements**

You can run the project directly in Google Colab
or set up a local Python environment:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

▶️ How to Run

1️⃣ Open the movie.ipynb notebook
2️⃣ Run each cell step-by-step
3️⃣ View regression visualizations and insights

**Let's answer some questions based on this**

1.Which movie has the highest worldwide grossing?<br/>
-Avatar(27,83,918,982)

2.Which movie has the lowest world wise grossing?<br/>
-The and fall of miss thang(40)

3.Which movie has the highest production budget?<br/>
-Avatar(425,000,000)

**Regression plot**

4.How much would a movie make with production budget of $1.5 million?<br/>
-using (Estimated Revenue=θ0​+θ1​⋅Budget)<br/>
y-intercept came out to be -6516010.52<br/>
slope came out to be 3.111<br/>

So,by that estimated revenue would be-$4,563,400 USD

**This may sound less because i have included data before 2000s which made the plot so.**

**🏁 Conclusion**

This project reveals how the movie industry has evolved over the last century using statistical regression and visual analytics.
It helps understand trends in audience preferences, movie success factors, and historical transitions in cinema.
